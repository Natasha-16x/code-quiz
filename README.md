## Description
This is a quiz application which uses HTML, CSS and Javascript. This application uses JavaScript to provide quiz questions, with a selection of 4 possible answers. The aim of this application is to collect user data to determine whether the answer chosen for each question is correct or not. If the answer is incorrect, it will remove 10 seconds from the remaining time. This then generates a score and shows the results on the final page.
